## Bonus: Multi-purpose source

1. The source code of this application can also be printed and, when correctly placed on a flat surface with the printout facing down, used just like a regular sheet of paper.
2. By creating several complicated and exact diagonal folds in the printout, a variety of objects vaugly representing some type of flying machine can be constructed.
3. By reorganising the individual characters of the source code, excerpts from over 50,000 works of litterature can be created.
